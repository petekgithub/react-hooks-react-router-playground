# What's inside here

## Learning goals:

- React router gives us control over how to navigate users around web applications.
- use the `useNavigate` hook and with `navigate`, I can effectively navigate the user to a related page.

** After logging in to the website, direct our user to the home page
** After logging out of the website, direct our user to the login page
